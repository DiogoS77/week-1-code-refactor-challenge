## Description

This project is a code refactor of a marketing website. This page in this (website) contains alot of information related to multiple subjects like Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. This website had a repetitive use of div tags, all the div tags were replaced with semantic elements, also cleaned the CSS by removing the repetitive classes that were doing the exactly same thing and using only one to make the code cleaner and more organised.
Now the website should include a main, header, section, article and footer elements, which are also adjusted in the CSS.

The biggest challenges i found while doing it, was my own frustration. The expectation of seeing the right look and seeing the completly opposite was one of the biggest challenges.
Another big challenge was actually understand what i was doing and why that was the right way.

The code refactoring is very important to modernise the way the code looks and also to make the job easier of understanding for a boss or a coleague that is going to read it. This makes it easier to understand , maintain and work with since everything will look more organnised and easier to find and sort out.

This Webpage now should have a better title that will make the page easier to be find and searchable for customer. Also with the div tags cleaned the page should be running way more smooth. The page had a small error while trying to use the navigation on the top but that issue now was fixed by adding an id that was missing. Now the user should be able navigate to different sections using the the top navigation options.

I think this challenge helped me understand how a website sturcture is made and how it works to make what we see when we open a website. Also there is some stuff that this challenge helped me improve that i will note below.

* How to write a ReadMe file
* How to refactor a HTML
* How to adjust a CSS with the changes made on the HTML
* How to work with semantic elements
* How to fix a navigation
